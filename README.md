# LibraryManagementSystem
Library management system in development process 
This project is a show case of my skills in Java.
Thanks to this project i learned a dozen of new skills and good practices since it was made from ground up.
The LibraryManagementSystem will be constantly updated untill it reaches perfection.
I'll try to upgrade the following:
- Instead of using List classes internally I will try to implement a SQL database to handle the data.
- I'll decide if this will be Desktop or Web application.
  - If Desktop I'll create GUI.
  - If Web application I'll do it via Spring.
